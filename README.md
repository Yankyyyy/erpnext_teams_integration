   - Create a new client secret (save this value securely)

5. **Note down these values:**
   - Application (client) ID
   - Directory (tenant) ID  
   - Client secret value

### Step 3: ERPNext Configuration

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Supported Doctypes

Currently supported doctypes with their participant fields:

| Doctype | Participants Field | Email Field | Subject Field |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Event | event_participants | email | subject |
| Project | users | email | project_name |

### Adding Custom Doctypes

To add support for additional doctypes, modify the `SUPPORTED_DOCTYPES` configuration in:
- `erpnext_teams_integration/api/chat.py`
- `erpnext_teams_integration/api/meetings.py`

Example:
```python
SUPPORTED_DOCTYPES = {
    "Task": {
        "participants_field": "assigned_users", 
        "email_field": "user",
        "subject_field": "subject"
    }
}
```

### Required Custom Fields

The app automatically creates these custom fields:

**Event & Project:**
- `custom_teams_chat_id` - Stores the Teams chat ID
- `custom_teams_meeting_url` - Stores the Teams meeting join URL
- `custom_join_teams_meeting` - Button to open meeting

**User:**
- `azure_object_id` - Microsoft Azure user ID for API calls

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Permissions

### Token Security
- Access tokens are stored securely in the database
- Automatic token refresh prevents expiration issues
- Tokens are never logged or exposed in error messages

### User Permissions
- Only users with appropriate ERPNext permissions can access Teams features
- Azure AD controls which users can join chats and meetings
- All API calls are made with delegated permissions

### Data Privacy
- Chat messages are stored locally for performance and offline access
- No sensitive data is transmitted unnecessarily
- Supports data cleanup and export for compliance

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Fails:**
- Verify Azure app permissions are granted admin consent
- Check redirect URI matches exactly (including https)
- Ensure client secret hasn't expired

**Users Not Found:**
- Run "Sync Azure IDs" to link Frappe users with Microsoft accounts
- Verify user emails match between systems
- Check user has Teams license in Microsoft 365

**API Rate Limits:**
- Microsoft Graph API has throttling limits
- Implement delays between bulk operations
- Monitor usage in Teams Settings statistics

**Chat Creation Fails:**
- Ensure all participants have Teams access
- Verify OAuth scopes include chat permissions
- Check error logs for specific API errors

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to your site config:

```python
# In sites/[site]/site_config.json
{
    "developer_mode": 1,
    "log_level": "DEBUG"
}
```

### Log Files

Check these log files for debugging:
- `logs/web.log` - General application logs
- `logs/worker.log` - Background job logs  
- Error Log doctype in ERPNext - Teams-specific errors

### Getting Help

1. **Check Error Logs** in ERPNext first
2. **Verify Configuration** using "Validate Configuration" button
3. **Test Connection** to confirm API access
4. **Review Microsoft Graph API documentation** for permission issues

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Indexes are automatically created for faster queries
- Regular cleanup of old messages recommended
- Consider archiving old conversation data

### API Optimization
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use batch operations where possible
- Monitor rate limits and implement backoff

### Best Practices
- Limit message history sync to recent data
- Use specific chat sync instead of bulk sync when possible
- Regular maintenance of Azure AD user mappings
